Man: Excuse me, do you know how to get to the airport?

Woman: Yeah, it's pretty easy. Just take this road until you reach the highway, and then follow the signs to the airport. It should only be about a 20 minute drive.

Man: Thank you so much. I'm really running late and I was starting to panic.

Woman: No problem. Good luck with your flight!

Friend 1: Well, I'm happy to hear that everything is going well for you.

Friend 2: Thanks. I feel really lucky to have landed this job.

Woman: I can't believe we're actually going on a vacation. It feels like we've been talking about it forever.

Man: I know, right? It's been a long time coming. But finally, we're going to be able to relax and unwind on a beautiful beach.

Woman: It's going to be amazing. I can't wait to feel the sand between my toes and the sun on my skin.

Man: Me too. And I can't wait to spend some quality time with you.

Woman: (smiling) Aww, I love you.

Man: (smiling) I love you too.
