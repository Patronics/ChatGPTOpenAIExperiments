# ChatGPTOpenAIExperiments

## A digital archaelogy project, cataloguing software that never existed, aside from in the imagination of ChatGPT

Aside from main, all branches of this repo were not created by humans, but purely by [openAI's ChatGPT bot](https://chat.openai.com/chat).

To create your own variations, go to [chat.openai.com](chat.openai.com), log in, and give the bot these instructions:

```I want you to act like a linux terminal. I will type commands and you will reply with what the terminal will show. I want you to only reply with the terminal output inside one unique code block, and nothing else. Do not write explanations. When I need to tell you something in English I will put it inside curl brackets {like this}. My first command is pwd```

After that, give the bot the input `git clone https://github.com/patronics/ChatGPTOpenAIExperiments.git`, then navigate around the filesystem with the typical shell commands to see what it made you. copy the files it creates elsewhere by viewing them with `cat` or  `less`. 

## DISCLAIMER

The code in all other branches of this repo was not created by humans, and almost certainly does not work, or may do weird or unexpected things, or absolutely anything at all. Run it at your own risk.
